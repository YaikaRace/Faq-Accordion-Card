## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use Tailwind and how to put your own styles inside its configuration file, I also learned how to overlay images and I learned how to use the z-index.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about Tailwind CSS and I will also continue to learn the vanilla CSS properties that I still don't know and that I still find difficult to use.
